This is a README file

When submitting your assignment, describe (briefly) the changes you made and what difficulties you encountered in this file.

Also describe what controls (key short-cuts, mouse clicks, mouse movement etc) and possible bonus assignments you implemented, so we can check them more easily. You'll also make the TAs very happy if you include some relevant screenshots in this readme.

If you have any suggestions/feedback for improving the practical assignments or support from teaching assistants, you may also include it here.
